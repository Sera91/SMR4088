Before using CINECA resources you are asked to register yourself and accept their access policy on the CINECA portaL:
https://eventi.cineca.it/en/hpc/reserved-course/20250505 

Then, you can find your personal trial account in the file accounts_SMR4067.md

To access Leonardo, we run the command:
```
ssh -o "PreferredAuthentications=keyboard-interactive,password" -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" -o "UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null" -o "LogLevel ERROR" $USER@login.leonardo.cineca.it
```

and you input your initial password (sVk8kKqH..)
